        content: <span>I worked as a <strong>Software Engineer at MCL Systems Ltd, Virginia, USA from September 2015 to March 2021</strong>. I worked with a small team of developers to brainstorm and implement ideas for a network monitoring software. I was involved in the planning and redesign of the application. I mainly worked with <strong>C# and MS SQL Server</strong> during my initial period for developing the software. I was later tasked with creating a web application to provide clients with an interface for monitoring their network. We made use of <strong>React, Redux, React Hooks</strong> for developing the front end of this application. We used <strong>MS SQL Server</strong> for database operations and <strong>NodeJS</strong> for carrying out backend services.</span>

I strive to be a <strong>team player and enjoy maintaining a good rapport with my colleagues</strong>.

All this greatly helped me to master the ability of <strong>multi-tasking and time management.</strong></span>
